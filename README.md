# Hangman Game (TDD + GUI in Python)
## Project Overview

This project is a Hangman game developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) and automated unit testing in Python.
It was created as part of a software engineering assignment to demonstrate:
1. Modular program design.
2. Automated unit testing with unittest.
3. Use of Tkinter for a graphical user interface (GUI).

### The game includes:
Basic Level: Random word generation.
Intermediate Level: Random phrase generation.
